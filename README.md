# Project (Wishlist Country and Its City).
[Eng/英語]
In this project, I want you to help me make a list of countries and cities you'd like to visit one day. Isn't traveling kind of a fun thing to do? and could be thought of as a hobby as well. I really like to travel because it's very interesting and it's fun to learn about new places and their cultures. Please choose the country you want to go to from the list below. For instance: Japan - Hiroshima.

[Jpn/日本語]
